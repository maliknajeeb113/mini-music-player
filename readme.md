## Features

- **Play/Pause Controls**: Easily control music playback
- **Navigation**: Skip to next or previous tracks
- **Shuffle**: Randomize your playlist order
- **Playlist Management**: Delete songs and reset your playlist
- **Visual Feedback**: Currently playing song is highlighted
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS variables and flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- SVG for button icons
- Web Audio API

## How It Works

The player loads a pre-defined list of songs and renders them in the playlist. Users can:

- Click on any song in the playlist to play it
- Use the control buttons to navigate between songs
- Delete songs from the playlist
- Reset the playlist when all songs have been deleted
- Shuffle the playlist order

The interface updates dynamically to reflect the current state of the player, highlighting the currently playing song and updating the display.
